# RJiter: Streaming JSON parser for Rust

RJiter is a wrapper for [jiter](https://github.com/pydantic/jiter) that allows to process a big JSON having a small buffer.

Documentation: Work in progress.

For usage, see [tests](https://github.com/olpa/streaming_json/tree/master/rjiter/tests).

RJiter has the same API as Jiter, plus methods to pass through long strings and bytes.
