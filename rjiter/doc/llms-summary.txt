RJiter - Streaming JSON Parser for Rust

RJiter is a streaming JSON parser that processes large JSON files using a small buffer. It wraps the Jiter library and adds streaming capabilities by automatically reading more data when needed.

Key Features:
- Memory-efficient parsing of large JSON files with small buffers
- Streaming API that handles buffer management automatically
- Support for pass-through of long strings without loading them entirely into memory
- Token skipping for mixed JSON/text content
- Built on top of the fast Jiter parser

Use Cases:
- Processing large JSON files that don't fit in memory
- Streaming JSON parsing with controlled memory usage
- JSON-to-JSON transformation with minimal memory footprint
- Parsing JSON mixed with other text content
